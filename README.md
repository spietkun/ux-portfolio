## Hi! 👋

Hi! I'm Szymon, UX Designer 🧠🎨.

Checkout my portfolio 👉🗂️ [Szymon Pietkun: UX designer](https://www.szymonpietkun.com/)

## Summary

This is a project which hosts my UX portfolio.

## Description

- I used teleporthq ([Professional website builder for developers | teleporthq.io](https://teleporthq.io/)) tool to build this website as it allows for code export. 

- UX case studies were created in Marktext tool, .md editor, which were later exported to html and linked to the website
